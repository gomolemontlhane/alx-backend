# Caching Algorithms Project

## Background Context

In this project, you will explore and implement various caching algorithms, understanding how each one operates and the contexts in which they're most effective.

## Resources

To help you understand the concepts in this project, here are some recommended resources:

- [Cache replacement policies - FIFO](#)
- [Cache replacement policies - LIFO](#)
- [Cache replacement policies - LRU](#)
- [Cache replacement policies - MRU](#)
- [Cache replacement policies - LFU](#)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without relying on external references:

### General

- Define a caching system and explain its purpose.
- Describe the following caching policies:
  - **FIFO (First In, First Out)**
  - **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**
  - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**
  - **MRU (Most Recently Used)**
  - **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**
- Identify the limitations of a caching system.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All files should be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.7)**.
- Each file must end with a new line.
- The first line of every file should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- **README.md** at the root of the project folder is required.
- Your code must adhere to the **pycodestyle** style guide (version 2.5).
- All files must be executable.
- File lengths will be checked using `wc`.
- **Documentation**:
  - Each module should include documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
  - All classes should include documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`).
  - Each function, whether inside or outside a class, should have documentation:
    - For standalone functions: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
    - For class methods: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
  - Documentation must be more than a simple word; it should be a full sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (sentence length will be verified).
